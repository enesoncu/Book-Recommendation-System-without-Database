# Project Title: Book Recommendation System without Database 

## Project Overview
This C# application implements a simple book recommendation system that doesn't rely on a database. It provides two recommendation methods:

**1. Category-Based:** Users can choose from predefined book categories (e.g., Roman, Romance, History) to receive recommendations.

**2. Mood-Based:** Users can select a mood (e.g., Happy, Depressed, Suspenseful) to get book suggestions that might suit their emotional state.

## Key Features
**- Randomized Recommendations:** The system randomly selects two books from the chosen category or mood array.

**- User Interaction:** A user-friendly interface guides users through the recommendation process.

**- Turkish Language Support:** The program is set to Turkish locale for text display and user prompts.

## How to Use
**1- Clone or Download the Repository:** Obtain the project files from GitHub or another source.

**2- Open in Development Environment:** Use a C# development environment like Visual Studio to open the project.

**3- Run the Application:** Execute the main program to start the book recommendation system.
